0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery

JavaScript is a programming language used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, and animation.

jQuery provides a concise and efficient syntax for interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page.

It allows developers to select and manipulate HTML elements using CSS-style selectors, such as $('selector').

jQuery provides a wide range of methods and functions for common tasks like handling events, making AJAX requests, and animating elements.

It abstracts away many cross-browser compatibility issues and provides a unified API for working with different browsers.

jQuery is built on top of JavaScript and can be used alongside other JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

To use jQuery, you need to include the jQuery library in your HTML file by adding a <script> tag with a link to the jQuery source file.

jQuery simplifies the process of creating interactive web applications by reducing the amount of code needed and providing a set of powerful utilities.

However, with the advancements in modern JavaScript and the introduction of new web standards, such as the native DOM manipulation methods and the Fetch API, the need for jQuery has diminished, and many of its features can now be achieved using plain JavaScript.
